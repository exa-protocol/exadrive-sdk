# Using a Bucket

## What is a Bucket

A bucket is the root folder for storing all your files which are relevant to a specific app. You can store and host any type of files here.

All the hosted files are public right now. We will launch private/restricted access soon.
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Navigate to the Buckets Section
