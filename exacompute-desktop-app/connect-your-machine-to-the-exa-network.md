# Connect your machine to the Exa Network

To connect your machine to the ExaCompute network, you need a valid machine token. Note that tokens are one-time use only, and the last created token cannot be reused. Follow the steps below to generate a new token and link your machine.

### Step 1: Generate a New Machine Token



1. **Navigate to the "Rent Your Machine" Section**:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)
   * Log in to the ExaCompute Dashboard.
   * Click on **Rent Your Machine** from the sidebar.
2. **Open Machine Settings**:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)
   * Locate your machine in the **Your Machines** list.
   * Click on the **Settings** button next to your machine.
3. **Generate and View a New Token**:\

   * In the settings panel, click **View Machine Token**.
   * A new token will be generated and displayed. Copy this token securely, as it will be required for linking your machine.

### Step 2: Open the ExaCompute Desktop App

1. **Launch the App**:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 9.43.04 AM.png>)
   * Open the ExaCompute Desktop App installed on your system.
2. **Enter Token**:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 9.43.23 AM.png>)
   * On the app's home screen, you will see the prompt: _"Do you have a Machine Token?"_
   * Click **Yes, I have one**.
3. **Paste the Token**:
   * Paste the copied machine token into the input field when prompted.
   * Click **Verify Token** to proceed.

### Step 3: Verify Connection

1. **Connection Confirmation**:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 9.44.19 AM.png>)
   * Once the token is verified, your machine will be successfully linked to the ExaCompute network.
   * The app will display a confirmation message indicating that your machine is now active on the network.
   * Initially you will be offline, to connect to the network click on the ⏻ button
2. **Monitor Status**:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 9.44.30 AM.png>)
   * Return to the ExaCompute Dashboard and check the **Your Machines** section.
   * The status of your machine should now display as **Online**, confirming it is contributing resources to the network.

### Notes

* If you encounter any issues during this process, ensure that:
  * You are using a newly generated token.
  * Your internet connection is stable.
* Tokens are unique and cannot be reused for another machine or session.

By following these steps, you can successfully link your machine to the ExaCompute network and start contributing compute resources.
