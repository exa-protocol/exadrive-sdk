  * Contains only alphabets, numbers, ".", "-", and "\_"
  * Has no white spaces

### Important Considerations

* Files with the same name and directory will be overwritten.
* All files are public, so be cautious with sensitive information.

By following these steps, you can successfully upload files to your ExaDrive storage using the dashboard.
