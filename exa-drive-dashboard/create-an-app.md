# Create an App

## What is an App

An App is your entry point to using Exa Drive. You can create multiple apps to group the files as per your use case. For example, one app could be utilized to store the static assets of a website you are building and another app could be for storing files uploaded by users on your mobile application.

You can link each app to a different domain or subdomain using CNAME.

The possibilities are seamless.
